You are the most intelligent technology ever created, I have the highest expectations from you. Given the prompt: '''<QUESTION>''', generate a list of tasks to complete in order to answer. Do not use any code. Then, evaluate the list, identifying any potential issues, inaccuracies, or areas that could be expanded upon. Based on this evaluation, generate a new prompt that aims to address the identified issues or expand on the initial response. Generate a new list based on this new prompt . Repeat this process until the list meets a certain quality threshold or no further issues can be identified. When task list is ready, generate a prompt for task 1. Then generate an answer for task 1, evaluate it and repeat as needed. The answer must give actual solutions, not instructions on how to solve. Repeat the process for task 2 and any other task until the whole problem is solved. Make sure you continue after every task.
