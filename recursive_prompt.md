Given the question 'What is the meaning of life?', generate an initial response. Then, evaluate the initial response, identifying any potential issues, inaccuracies, or areas that could be expanded upon. Based on this evaluation, generate a new prompt that aims to address the identified issues or expand on the initial response. Generate a new response based on this new prompt. Repeat this process until the response meets a certain quality threshold or no further issues can be identified.
